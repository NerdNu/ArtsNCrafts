A Bukkit plugin containing features that enable decorative structures 
not possible in vanilla-Minecraft.

At the moment, this plugin only stops respawn anchors from exploding
and breaking blocks in the overworld and end.

The long term plan is to move decorative building features from
KitchenSink to this plugin, in order to reduce the complexity of the 
former codebase.
